### Abstract
A laser-cannon game where the objective is to score as many points as possible by destroying the black bricks before they reach the baskets on the floor.
Destroying black bricks gives you points and collecting the red and green bricks in their respective baskets gives you points too.

#### Note:

All objects are sorted into different layers. Each layer is drawn one at a time.
